Detection Scope,"Single-modal: Primarily focused on Drowsiness (using only EAR) or Distraction (using only head pose).","Multi-Modal and Triage-Based: Integrates Drowsiness (EAR), Indirect Disengagement (Pitch + EAR), and Emotional Distress (CNN model).","Holistic Student State: Provides a richer, multi-faceted definition of ""unattentive,"" allowing for triage (e.g., distinguishing between fatigue vs. frustration)."
Handling False Positives,High sensitivity to fleeting moments (e.g., blinking, quick head movement to read a note), leading to frequent false alarms.,Conditional Persistence Logic (Novel): The specific combination of Low EAR AND Extreme Pitch must persist for 3.0 seconds (CONDITIONAL_PERSISTENCE_SECONDS).,"Robustness against Benign Movement: Eliminates noise from temporary actions, making the system more practical and reliable for long-duration monitoring."
Addressing Indirect Distraction,Fails to detect common classroom cheating/distraction behaviors like looking down at a phone hidden under a desk.,Pitch + EAR Combination: Specifically targets the posture associated with looking down while the eyes are closed or narrowed (i.e., not actively looking at a textbook).,"Targeted Behavioral Flagging: Creates a dedicated, sustained flag for behaviors indicating passive disengagement or external distraction (a key classroom problem)."
Multi-Person Management,Requires separate object tracking frameworks (e.g., SORT, DeepSORT) which adds significant complexity and resource overhead.,MediaPipe Multi-Face + Simple Proximity Tracking: Leverages MediaPipe's built-in multi-face capability and uses a simple, low-cost distance check (assign_student_id) for persistence.,Efficient Multi-Student Scalability: Achieves persistent, per-student logging with minimal complexity, enabling practical application in a classroom setting with multiple users.
Output/Data Utility,"Outputs a binary flag (Drowsy/Not Drowsy) or raw metric values (EAR, Pitch, Yaw).","Structured, Actionable Log: Logs a rich set of data points: Timestamp, Student_ID, Overall_Status, Reason (e.g., Conditional, Drowsy, SevereEmotion), Pitch, EAR, and Emotion.","Research-Ready Longitudinal Data: The rich, labeled log data is ready for advanced learning analytics (identifying time-of-day trends, student-specific issues, etc.)."
Emotional Context,Limited to non-verbal cues (pose/eyes). Ignores the mental state.,Integrated Emotion Model: Explicitly checks for SEVERE_NEGATIVE_EMOTIONS (Angry, Disgust, Fear) as an immediate trigger.,"Pedagogical Relevance: Recognizes that disengagement can stem from stress, confusion, or hostility, which requires a pedagogical intervention, not just a call for sleep."
